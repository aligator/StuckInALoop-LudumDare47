Ludum Dare 47

## Gameplay
You are stuck,  
stuck in a fight you have to do over and over again...

... but you will find power ups which improve your abilities!
However, they will only take effect __after you get destroyed__.  

You control a spaceship wit _W A S D_ (move)and _SPACE_ (shoot).  
Each time you get destroyed, you will face the same enemies but improve your skills over time due to the power ups.  

## Power up
There are 3 types:  
* <img src="https://github.com/aligator/StuckInALoop-LudumDare47/blob/master/android/assets/life.png" height="24"> live
* <img src="https://github.com/aligator/StuckInALoop-LudumDare47/blob/master/android/assets/damage.png" height="24"> damage
* <img src="https://github.com/aligator/StuckInALoop-LudumDare47/blob/master/android/assets/fire_rate.png" height="24"> fire rate

If you got the maximum possible amount of a power up, it will no longer spawn and the text on the right turns green.  
__Note that you have to die to enable newly collected power ups!__

## Goal
Destroy all enemies. You have to destroy all of them, or the game will restart.  
You can see the remaining enemy count on the top left.
